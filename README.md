Rubika  integration/staging repository
======================================


Rubika  (RBK) is a sustainable cryptocurrency modeled after Satoshi Nakamotoâ€™s vision for Bitcoin. It is a decentralized, peer-to-peer transactional currency designed to offer a solution to the problem posed by the exponential increase in energy consumed by Bitcoin and other proof-of-stake currencies. Proof-of-stake mining is environmentally sustainable and it is not required a high-powered mining hardware. Rubika  utilizes an energy efficient proof-of-stake algorithm, can be mined on any computer, and will never require specialized mining equipment.
